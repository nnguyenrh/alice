:: About [etc]
Hi Alice!
First of all, happy birthday! For now I won't say much else because that's going to be in your [[birthday card|Card]] ;)
I don't really know what to call this gift. More accurately, it is a <b>twine game</b>, which is an interactive fiction game template. 
It's not really a game. It's more like a visual novel, and the novel is composed of the rescue mission natura thread you, Sas, and Kai wrote together.
I wanted you to have a place where you could revisit one of your favorite pieces of writing in an aesthetically appealing and beautiful way. :) 

I hope you enjoy!
